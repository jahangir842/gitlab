### Notes: GitLab Runners and Repository Management

---

#### **1. GitLab Runner Overview**
- GitLab Runner prepares the environment, fetches repository changes, and executes the pipeline.
- The repository is fetched into a working directory, and if it already exists, it is reinitialized to ensure a clean state.
- A shallow clone may be used to fetch a limited commit history for efficiency.

---

#### **2. Repository Handling**
- The runner fetches or clones the repository into the working directory.
- The repository is reinitialized to ensure consistency if it already exists.
- The `git depth` setting controls how many commits to fetch.

---

#### **3. Repository Behavior**
- On Linux, the default shell is usually `bash`, with the option to use other shells.
- File paths follow POSIX standards (e.g., `/builds/...`).
- Git strategy options:
  - `clone`: Clones the repository from scratch.
  - `fetch`: Reuses the existing repository and fetches changes.
  - `none`: Skips repository-related operations.

---

#### **4. Security Risks**
- **Shared Runners**: Repository data may be exposed due to multi-user access.
- **Leftover Data**: Files may persist between jobs, posing a security risk.
- **Custom Scripts**: Untrusted or malicious scripts can expose sensitive data.
- **Compromised Machines**: Self-hosted runners can be targeted if not properly secured.

#### **5. Best Practices to Secure Runners**
1. **Runner Isolation**:
   - Use specific runners for sensitive projects and assign them to protected branches or tags.
2. **Cleanup Between Jobs**:
   - Ensure cleanup to remove files after each job.
3. **Environment Variables**:
   - Use protected variables to restrict access and limit exposure.
4. **Containerized Executors**:
   - Use Docker executors for better job isolation.
5. **Repository Access**:
   - Use shallow cloning to minimize repository data exposure.
   - Skip Git operations when not needed.
6. **Review `.gitlab-ci.yml`**:
   - Validate scripts to prevent the execution of malicious content.
7. **Artifact and Log Security**:
   - Restrict access to artifacts and mask sensitive data in logs.
8. **Monitor Activity**:
   - Track runner usage and review audit logs.
9. **Self-Hosted Runners**:
   - Use isolated networks and lock runners to specific projects or groups.

#### **6. GitLab Tools and Configurations**
- **Protected Branches/Tags**: Limit pipelines to trusted branches.
- **Job-Specific Rules**: Control job execution using `rules:` in the `.gitlab-ci.yml` file.
- **Audit Logs**: Monitor and track repository and runner activity.
