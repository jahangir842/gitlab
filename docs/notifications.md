### GitLab Built-in Notifications: Detailed Notes

GitLab provides built-in notification systems to keep users informed about events happening within the GitLab platform. These notifications help users stay updated on a variety of actions related to repositories, pipelines, issues, merge requests, and more. Notifications can be delivered via several channels, including emails, web notifications, and integrations with external services like Slack.

Here’s a detailed breakdown of GitLab’s built-in notification system:

---

### 1. **Types of GitLab Notifications**

GitLab notifications are triggered by a wide range of events in your project or group, including:

- **Push events**: Notifies when code is pushed to the repository.
- **Merge requests**: Notifies when a merge request is created, updated, merged, or closed.
- **Pipeline events**: Notifies when a CI/CD pipeline starts, succeeds, or fails.
- **Issues**: Notifies when issues are created, commented on, or closed.
- **Commits**: Notifies when new commits are made to a branch.
- **Tagging**: Notifies when tags are pushed to the repository.
- **Comments and activity**: Notifies when new comments are added to issues, merge requests, or commits.
- **Pipeline status**: Notifies users about the success, failure, or other statuses of pipelines.

Notifications can also be related to project or group activities, such as the creation of new repositories, changes to project settings, or invitations to join groups.

### 2. **Notification Methods**

GitLab supports different methods for receiving notifications, depending on user preferences:

- **Email Notifications**
- **GitLab Web Notifications**
- **Slack and Mattermost Integration**
- **Mobile Push Notifications** (via the GitLab mobile app)

#### **2.1. Email Notifications**

Email is one of the primary ways GitLab sends notifications. Users can receive notifications for different events, such as updates to issues, merge requests, pipelines, and commits.

- **How it works**: GitLab will send an email to the user’s registered email address whenever one of the specified events occurs (e.g., a merge request is created or a pipeline fails).
- **Settings**: Users can configure email notifications for various events. The settings are found under **User Profile > Notifications**.
- **Types of Email Notifications**:
  - **Pipeline Success or Failure**: You can receive an email when a pipeline succeeds or fails.
  - **Merge Request Notifications**: Emails are sent when a merge request is created, updated, commented on, or merged.
  - **Issue Notifications**: Emails are sent when an issue is created, updated, commented on, or closed.

#### **2.2. GitLab Web Notifications**

GitLab provides web-based notifications that appear within the GitLab interface itself. These notifications are visible when users are logged into GitLab.

- **How it works**: Web notifications appear in the GitLab UI, typically in the top-right corner of the page, where users can see updates on events like new merge requests, comments on issues, or pipeline results.
- **Settings**: Users can enable or disable web notifications by going to their user profile and adjusting the **Notification settings**.
- **Use Case**: Web notifications are useful for users who are logged into GitLab and want real-time updates without checking email.

#### **2.3. Slack and Mattermost Notifications (Integration)**

GitLab can integrate with messaging platforms like **Slack** and **Mattermost** to send notifications to channels or direct messages. This is especially useful for teams that rely on these platforms for communication.

- **How it works**: GitLab sends messages about job statuses (e.g., success or failure), commits, or issue updates to a specific Slack or Mattermost channel.
- **Setup**: 
  - In GitLab, go to your project’s **Settings > Integrations**.
  - Choose **Slack notifications** (or **Mattermost**) and provide the webhook URL from Slack or Mattermost.
- **Types of Notifications**:
  - **Pipeline Status**: Notify Slack about the success or failure of a pipeline.
  - **Merge Request Comments**: Notify Slack when comments are made on merge requests.
  - **Job Status**: Notify Slack when a specific job within a pipeline completes.

#### **2.4. Mobile Push Notifications (via GitLab App)**

For users on the go, the GitLab mobile app provides push notifications to mobile devices (iOS and Android). These notifications can inform users of pipeline status, comments, merge requests, and other important updates.

- **How it works**: Users install the GitLab mobile app and log into their account. They can configure which notifications they want to receive on their mobile device.
- **Types of Mobile Notifications**:
  - **Pipeline Failures/Successes**: Get push notifications when a pipeline fails or completes.
  - **Merge Request and Issue Updates**: Receive updates on merge requests and issues that you’re watching or involved in.
  - **New Comments**: Be notified when someone comments on a merge request or issue you’re watching.

### 3. **Managing Notification Settings**

GitLab allows users to customize their notification preferences based on their role in the project, the type of event, and the frequency of the notifications. The settings are divided into two categories:

- **Global Settings**: Notifications for all projects and groups.
- **Project/Group-specific Settings**: Notifications for specific projects or groups.

#### **3.1. Global Notification Settings**

Users can configure global notification settings from their profile page:

1. **Navigate to Profile > Notifications**.
2. **Choose a Notification Level**: GitLab provides different levels of notifications:
   - **Disabled**: No notifications for this event.
   - **Participating**: Notifications when you are directly involved in an issue, merge request, or pipeline (e.g., if you're the assignee, reporter, or reviewer).
   - **Watching**: Notifications for all activity related to the issue or merge request, even if you are not directly involved.
   - **Global**: Notifications for all activities across all issues, merge requests, and projects.
   - **Custom**: You can define specific notification settings for each type of event.

#### **3.2. Project/Group Notification Settings**

In addition to global settings, GitLab allows project-level notification preferences. This can be configured by project maintainers or admins.

1. **Navigate to Project Settings > Integrations > Notifications**.
2. **Configure Individual Notifications**: Admins can configure webhook integrations, email notifications, and other project-specific events.

#### **3.3. Notification Frequency**

GitLab allows users to adjust the frequency of notifications for different events:

- **Immediate**: Get a notification as soon as the event occurs.
- **At most once a day**: Get a summary of all the notifications for the day at a specified time.
- **At most once a week**: Get a weekly digest of all notifications.

GitLab provides the following levels of notification preferences for different events:

### 5. **Advanced Notification Management**

GitLab also offers advanced notification options to manage how and when notifications are triggered:

- **Custom Webhooks**: GitLab allows you to configure custom webhooks to notify external services (e.g., Jira, PagerDuty, or custom systems).
- **External Services Integration**: As mentioned earlier, GitLab can integrate with third-party services like Slack, Mattermost, Jira, and others to send notifications about events.
- **Notification Filters**: Use filters to restrict notifications to specific branches, tags, or pipelines.
